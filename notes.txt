Sure. Thank you. I will add the list here.
- Healing, stunning, and buffing.
- I want it to be able to target any character so I can attack my teammate or I can heal the enemy.
- When buffing a character attack, an icon next to their healthbar should appear and their attack increases for 3 turns then after 3 turns the buff ends.
- Make characters gain experience after defeating enemy and increase stats when level up. The tiny blue bar under their health is the experience bar.
- Give team bonus +1 defense if the player team has warrior, archer, and mage.
- Make skills count use and become unavailable after use is 0
- Add keyboard controls.
